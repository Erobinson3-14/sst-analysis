# sst-analysis
A repository for a python function that can plot data from a sea surface temperature data set from noaa
Function 1 plots sea surface temperature at the latest time in an SST data set
Function 2 plots temperature vs time at a given set of coordinates
Function 3 is supposed to load'time' vector from a SST dataset, then convert it into a python datetime object. Might not work.
See the Uses_Examples.ipynp file for examples of how to use and call cobe_functions
